# ParkiT-Senior-Design
This repository contains the python code for the demo I made for the 2015 Rice University Senior Design Showcase.
Our team ParkiT used a camera-based system and computer vision algorithms to detect whether outdoor parking 
spots are open. The camera used for the demo is no longer on Rice stadium so theso the demo is obselete, but you 
can see the media relase with video at the below link:
